# Exploratory Data Analysis on 'TMDB' Movie Data

## Overview
This repository focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a a given 'TMDB' movie dataset. The primary objective is to explore the data, draw insights, and present visualizations showcasing various trends and patterns within the dataset.

## Expectations
- Perform exploratory data analysis on the movie dataset.
- Present three Python visualizations showcasing insights drawn from the data.
- Identify and explain two key points derived from the data in Markdown format.
- Select two movies for an in-depth single observation analysis, comparing them to similar movies and highlighting their unique aspects.

## Contents:
### 1. EDA and Data Cleaning: 
   - Cleaning up column data types
   - Formatting the data into usable columns
   - Looking into null values

### 2. Visualising the Dataset: 
   - Using Pairplots, Histograms and Scatter plots to visualise possible correlations within the data

## In-depth Analysis of Selected Movies
- Comparing movies with duplicate titles to explore their differences.
- Although having the same title these two films showed all other factors to be distinctly different
### Batman 1989
- This film had overall greater popularity, revenue and budget

### Batman 1966
- This film had overall lower popularity, revenue and budget

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Conclusion
The assignment demonstrates the application of EDA techniques to extract insights from a movie dataset. By analyzing the data and visualizing trends, we gain a deeper understanding of various aspects of the movie industry captured within this data set.
